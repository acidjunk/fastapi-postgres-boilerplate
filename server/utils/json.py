"""Functions for custom serialization to and from JSON.

Both :func:`json.dumps` and :func:`json.loads` provide hooks for encoding and decoding objects they normally can't
encode and decode. Their hooks operate somewhat differently though.

:func:`json.dumps` has a `default` keyword argument that can be supplied with a function that will **only** be called
for objects it cannot encode. This function should return a new Python object (not a str in JSON format!) that can be
serialized to JSON by the active encoder. Generally this means that we should convert custom data types to either a
`str`, `int`, `float`, `bool` or a `dict` with only these primitive values. As the `default` function is a matter of
last resort it should raise a :exc:`TypeError` if it too can't encode an object. We have named the `default` function
:func:`to_serialize`.

To ensure we can decode what we have encoded we will include extra information about the custom data types, namely:

- the module the data type resides in
- the name of the data type

This information is encoded under the keys `"__module__"` and `"__class__"` respectively.

Upon decoding this information will be used to import the module and instantiate the class for the the custom data
type dynamically. One obviously has to encode whatever information that's necessary to be able to decode it later as
well.

.. note:: There are libraries that provide this functionally out of the box. We have chosen not to use them as their
   means of encoding dumps the _internal_ representation of custom types. This can lead to fairly unreadable JSON. Eg.
   encoding a :obj:`uuid.UUID` object results in a large integer value plus an additional attribute `is_safe` that has
   no meaning to us. We, instead, want something that's human readable as well.

.. warning:: Another thing to realize is that although we do encode :obj:`uuid.UUID` objects, we do not decode them.
   Past project decisions still haunt use and we generally process UUIDs as `str`s in our backend, only converting them
   to real :obj:`uuid.UUID` objects where necessary. Don't simply assume UUID decoding logic was forgotten; it was not!

.. note:: Even though we do serialize domain models for audit log purposes to the state, we do not deserialize from
   the state. Instead we look them up in the DB instead (see: func:`server.utils.state.inject_args`). The reason for
   this decision is that we don't want to break currently running workflows when data models have their definition
   changed. If the database is the serialization store, we can deal with changes by means of DB data migrations. This
   is much, much harder to do when the serialization store is a JSON blob.

:func:`json.loads`'s hook works somewhat differently. Whereas the `default` function of :func:`json.dumps` is only
called as a matter of last resort, the `object_hook` function of :func:`json.loads is called for every `dict` value!
This means that, instead of raising an exception, it should return the `dict` that was passed in if it can't decode it.

The `object_hook` function will be called with the inner most `dict` first, working its way up to the top level `dict`.
Eg. Given::

    json_str = '{"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": {"x": true, "y": false}}'

The `object_hook` function will be called twice. First with the `dict`::

    {'x': True, 'y': False}

And then with the `dict`::

    {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': {'x': True, 'y': False}}

:func:`json.loads` will replace the `dict` that it passed to `object_hook` function, with the object that the
`object_hook` function returned.

We have named the `object_hook` function :func:`from_serializable`. Reason for naming these custom encoding and
decoding functions differently then `default` and `object_hook` is that they are also used outside of the context of
:func:`json.dumps` and :func:`json.loads`.
